Demonstration of Intel OpenCL issue
===================================

ref: https://github.com/sergeyvfx/intel_opencl_nvcc_test

There seems to be an issue in one of Intel OpenCL libraries, which closes stdin
file descriptor, which might cause issues with various other routines. For example,
it will make it impossible to invoke nvcc after querying OpenCL platforms.

This repository contains a simplified version of what's happening in Blender. This
could be summarized as following:

- First, we query OpenCL platforms from Blender side
- Second, we try to compile CUDA kernel using external command to NVCC.
  This step will fail, with NVCC reporting:

    <built-in>: fatal error: when writing output to : Bad file descriptor

What happens inbetween of this two steps is libigdrcl.so closing stdin file
descriptor when it's being unloaded. This makes NVCC (and maybe other GCC/Clang
related commands?) to be fully unhappy.

Steps to reproduce:

- Compile the project, using `make` command.
- Run `intel_opencl_test` binary, which does the two steps described above.
- This step should give issue mentioned above.
- It is also possible to get some sort of backtrace by pre-loading myclose.so
  library (which is also compiled by makefile):

    LD_PRELOAD=./myclose.so gdb ./intel_opencl_test

  Running the program will give the following backtrace:
