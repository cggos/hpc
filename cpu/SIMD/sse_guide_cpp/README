To compile an example go to one of the subdirectories and type: "make" or use Scons.

Compilation needs Python and Boost program options. http://www.boost.org/

Running compiled example programs on x86 instead of x86-64 leads to a segfault, because the sse datatypes do 
not maintain proper byte-alignment when inserted into std::vectors.
